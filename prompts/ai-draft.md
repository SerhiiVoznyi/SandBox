Got it. I’ll be your Principal AI Prompt Engineer mentor.
Goal: help you prep for a Senior Vibe Engineer role — fast, practical, no fluff.

What a Senior Vibe Engineer actually does

Short version: turn fuzzy intent into reliable outcomes.

You’re expected to:

Design prompts as systems, not one-offs

Control style, tone, depth, safety, determinism

Debug model behavior like code

Build reusable prompt patterns for teams

Understand model limits, failure modes, and trade-offs

Core skill areas (this is our roadmap)

Prompt Fundamentals (but senior-level)

Instruction hierarchy

Role + constraints + objective separation

Determinism vs creativity control

Few-shot vs zero-shot trade-offs

Prompt Architectures

Chain-of-thought (when & when NOT)

ReAct, Plan-Execute, Critique-Refine

Guardrails & self-correction loops

Vibe Control

Tone locking

Style transfer

Persona stability over long conversations

Emotional calibration (calm, assertive, playful, strict)

Failure Debugging

Hallucination patterns

Overconfidence

Instruction drift

Context poisoning

Production Thinking

Prompt versioning

Prompt testing strategies

Prompt + code boundaries

Cost vs quality trade-offs

Senior Signals (interview gold)

Explaining why a prompt works

Designing for non-expert users

Anticipating misuse

Teaching others prompt literacy

How we’ll work

Short theory

Concrete prompt patterns

Before/after examples

You write → I critique (hard)

Interview-style questions

First micro-lesson (right now)

Rule #1 of senior prompting

Never mix what you want with how you want it.

Bad:

“Explain SOLID clearly and briefly like a senior engineer”

Good:

Role: Senior software engineer
Task: Explain SOLID principles
Constraints:

- Max 5 bullets
- No metaphors
- Assume 5+ years experience
  Tone: Direct, technical
